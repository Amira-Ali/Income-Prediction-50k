how to use se with split:
Stratification
While SE helps you interpret your results, there is a much more important check you need to do immediately after a train/test split, especially in classification problems: Stratification.
Instead of a simple random split, you almost always want to use a stratified split.
Feature	Random Split	Stratified Split
Goal	Assigns rows randomly.	Ensures class ratios are preserved.
Risk	Test set might randomly get all the rare classes.	All classes are evenly distributed across train/test sets.
Recommended?	No, generally avoided.	Yes, highly recommended.
In summary: The SE is a mathematical measure of precision. A 70/30 split in a large dataset automatically guarantees a low SE for your evaluation metrics. Your main practical concern should be using stratification to ensure both sets are representative of all class types.
